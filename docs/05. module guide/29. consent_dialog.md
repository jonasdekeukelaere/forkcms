# Consent dialog

The Consent Dialog allows the visitor to give "consent" for different levels. We follow Google Consent Mode v2. 

## Configuration in Google Tag Manager

1. Enable "Consent mode support"
    * Click Admin â†’ Container Settings
    * Enable "Enable consent overview" under "Additional settings"
2. Use the `Consent initialization - All Pages` trigger instead of `All Pages`.
3. On all tags you are now able to configure the required consent.

See [https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/10718549?hl=en](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/10718549?hl=en) 
for all details.

### Advanced

If you want to trigger something when the visitor updates consent

1. Create a trigger
    * Trigger Type: Custom Event
    * Event name: `consentUpdate`
    * This trigger fires on: All Custom Events
2. Add this trigger to all needed tags. In most cases you will need to add this as an extra trigger (or).


## Show the Consent Dialog with javascript

In some situations you will need to show the Consent Dialog again. For instance to allow the visitor to revisit 
their consents, or if the user wants to see extra content wherefor consent is required (e.g.: YouTube embed).

The consent dialog can be reopened by executing the following JS:

```javascript
jsFrontend.consentDialog.show()
```


## Check for consent in Javascript

The choices of the visitor are available in jsData in the privacyConsent-object.

* `possibleLevels`, contains all the levels that are defined in the CMS.
* `levelsHash`, this is the hash that is used to determine if the levels are changed.
* `visitorChoices`, this contains the choice a user has made per level. The default is false.

So for example if you want to do some personalization if the user has given consent for `personalization_storage`:

```javascript
if (
  jsData.privacyConsent.possibleLevels.includes('personalization_storage')
  && jsData.privacyConsent.visitorChoises.personalization_storage
) {
  // do personalization
  ...
}
```


## Check for consent in PHP

A service is available as `ForkCMS\Privacy\ConsentDialog`. This service exposes some methods that you can use:

* `public static function getConsentLevels(): array`: This will return all possible levels. These are the Consent Mode v2 levels.
* `public function isDialogEnabled(): bool`: Returns true if the Consent Dialog is enabled, false if not.
* `public function getLevels(bool $includeFunctional = false): array`: this will return all the levels that are enabled in the CMS.
* `public function getVisitorChoices(): array`: Returns an array with the users chosen preferences
* `public function hasAgreedTo(string $level): bool`: Returns a boolean if the user has agreed to a given level or not. Returns false per default, also for non existing levels.

So for example if you want to do personalization if the user has given consent for `personalization_storage`, you 
can use the snippet below:

```php
<?php
...

use ForkCMS\Privacy\ConsentDialog;

...

    $consentDialog = $this->getContainer()->get(ConsentDialog::class);
    if($consentDialog->hasAgreedTo('personalization_storage')) {
        // do personalisation
        ...
    }
...
```
